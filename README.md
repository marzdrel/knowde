## Knowde code assignment

Implement a Point of Sale
Assuming that you have:
  - Input device: Barcode scanner with Exit button
  - Two output devices:
    - LCD Display
    - Printer

You should implement the following app:
  - Single product sale
    - Barcode is being scanned
    - If the product is found in the database then the product name and price is printed on LCD Display
    - If the product is not available then “Product not found” error message is printed on LCD Display
  - When Exit button is pressed
    - List of all properly scanned items with prices is displayed on Printer as well as the Total Sum
    - Total Sum of all items prices is displayed on a LCD Display

Additional notes
  - Of course we don’t want you to use a real barcode scanner. It’s only about modeling abstract apps; scanning a product can be HTTP request or even a simple function call, output device can be STDOUT or a file.
  - Do not spend more than couple of hours on the task
  - Provide clean and idiomatic code depending on your language of choice (e.g. SOLID principles)
  - Code can be delivered as a private repository or ZIP. Please include instructions on how to run it.

Good luck!
